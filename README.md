# ArcaneCrypt
ArcaneCrypt is a desktop application that provides encrypted file storage. It creates an encrypted "vault" that securely stores your files.

## Features

- [AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) encryption using the [Fernet](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/fernet/) algorithm to encrypt your files
- Automatically decrypts files when you want to access them
- Provides a secure encrypted vault for storing sensitive files on Windows

ArcaneCrypt provides an intuitive user interface for easy encrypted storage of your files. Create vaults, add files by dragging and dropping them, then lock your vault to encrypt your files. Your files are encrypted using the [AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) [Fernet](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/fernet/) algorithm.

The main window displays all unencrypted files in your vault. You can double click files to open them, right click for menu options like renaming and removing, or drag and drop to move files between folders. LockWarden makes encryption easy so you can have peace of mind that your sensitive files and data are safe and secure.

Some tips:

- Use a strong, unique password for each vault.
- Keep your password safe and backed up in case you forget it.
